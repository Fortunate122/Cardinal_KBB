# Cardinal KBB

## Description
This is a full-stack Kanban board application built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL. The app features full JWT authentication and supports login/logout, protected API access, and secure token handling. Users can create and manage Kanban tickets, which persist in a PostgreSQL database. The app is fully deployable to Render with separate services for frontend, backend, and database.

## Motivation
My motivation behind this app was to practice building a production-grade, authenticated full-stack application using modern frameworks and technologies, while implementing a visually polished user interface with persistent and secure backend data handling.

## Usage
This project demonstrates JWT-based auth, PostgreSQL schema setup, Sequelize ORM integration, and React UI management. It also includes a login flow with token validation, route protection, and logout. Tickets can be created and assigned across swimlanes in a classic Kanban style.

## License
This project is licensed under the None license.

## Learning
I learned how to structure a scalable full-stack app, implement JWT authentication with token validation middleware, manage protected routes, handle CORS and environment configuration for Render, and theme a React app using modern CSS practices.

## Standout
What makes this project stand out is:
- Full-stack architecture (PostgreSQL + Sequelize + Express + React)
- Real authentication using JWT
- Protected routes and session handling
- Kanban ticket management system
- Earth-toned, accessible, and clean UI
